# DDLC: 3 A.I.R. Recreation
<b>This mod is not suitable for children or those who are easily disturbed.</b>

This mod recreates DDLC by taking advantage of 3air's potential in what is allowed to be passed through the game, and reading the game's decompilation to extract the game assets!

The mod uses a custom-made Visual Novel engine dubbed the "Ren'Py Interpreter Engine", or "Ren'P-IE" for short, to do the interpretation of the ".rpy" scripts.


## How to set up
<b>Step 1:</b> Obtain the original game's assets. The easiest way to do this is to go to the <a href="https://github.com/Blobadoodle/ddlc-decompiled/tree/main">DDLC Decompilation Github</a> and download the files from there.

<b>Step 2:</b> Insert the folders from the decompilation into the mod folder. The "fonts.rpa" folder is not required. Do NOT place any folders into any other folders, they must be plaved in the same place as the "mod.json". The list of folders in the mod should now be:
- "scripts"
- "sprites"
- "audio"
- "scripts.rpa"
- "images.rpa"
- "audio.rpa"
  
And that's it! The game should be able to read these assets perfectly, and all you need to do now is enabled the mod and enter the game.
